# Door Frame & Assembly
\label{cha:door-frame}

We are now ready to build our door-frame system. In this chapter, we'll learn the powerful techniques of:

- Using sketches to assess and specify motion (Section~\ref{sec:})
- Creating a multi-body model (Section~\ref{sec:})

Our process will be as follows:

1. Sketch the geometry of the door, frame, and hinge within a single Part file (Section~\ref{sec:})
2. Turn those sketches into solid bodies (Section~\ref{sec:})
3. Break this multi-body part out into part files containing only a single body (Section~\ref{sec:})
4. Build an assembly of the parts and confirm we've achieved our goals (Section~\ref{sec:})
