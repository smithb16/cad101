1. Using each of the sketch entities, create a self-portrait.
  - If you've gotten through this, figure out what the entities are for.
2. Draw a hammer. Define all sketch entities
3. Defining w/ dimensions - Start with four lines. Fully define with dimensions. Restart and define with relations and one dimension.
  - Extra credit: Add arcs to each of the 4 sides of the square. Make a circumscribed square.


General thoughts:

Dimensions - Start with fully defined. Add a driven dimension. Make the driven dimension driving, and fix the broken stuff.

Defining w/ dimensions - Start with four lines. Fully define with dimensions. Restart and define with relations and one dimension.
